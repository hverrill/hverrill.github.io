                I've always loved computers. When I was 14, I found my first coding course online. When I graduated
                high school, I traveled to attend a school called <a class="link"
                    href="https://www.rose-hulman.edu/">Rose-Hulman</a> for
                Software Engineering. Despite my passion, however, I came to realize that something was wrong, and
                needed to change. At the end of my sophomore year, I transferred to Kennesaw State University, and
                changed my major to Interaction Design.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was rough on me. My supposed lifelong dream was simply not what I actually wanted, and that hurt.
                Then, I took an Intro to Philosophy class, and my life opened up for me. I realized that even before
                I was glued to a screen and modding video games, I was reading dozens of books and thinking about
                the world. I was a humanities kid who loved computers. Today, my education reflects my journey, and
                the path I intend to follow.
            </p>
            <p>
                I intend to approach User Experience and Interaction design from the perspective of both the user
                and the producer, supplemented by my skill in technical and creative writing. As I continue my
                education, I will apply that multi-faceted approach to Library and Information Science, to present
                the most important information in the best possible way, both on the screen and on the shelf. In so
                doing, making the world a better place.
