                </h3>
                <p>
                    This project was titled Booktunes. The concept behind booktunes is to make it easy for readers to find playlists and songs that match the "vibe" of the book they're reading. If you're reading Lord of the Rings, the music might be tense and epic. If you're reading Harry Potter, the music might be wondrous with strings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To design the app prototype, we used a process called Goal Directed Design, or GDD. As it was a class settings, our team leader was the creator of the idea, so the requirements phase was dropped.
                </p>

                    Method
                </h3>
                <p>
                    GDD, or Goal Directed Design, was created by Alan Cooper, and is detailed in his book 'About Face â€“ The essentials of interaction design'. The method is a behavior and evidence-based design process that uses research to create a fictional "persona", or average user, and then use that persona to create a robust application that fulfils the persona's requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, our team leader was the creator of the idea, so the normally included requirements phase was dropped.

                <p>The Research Phase is all about collecting data. In the research phase, you look at competitors, review research literature, interview potential users, and talk with stakeholders. </p>
                <p>
                    Our Research Phase had five subphases.
