                    For this project, me and my partner Evan Slater worked together to create a working web application. Our goal was to learn about web development and create the final product over the 10 weeks of the quarter, implementing features and foundations as we went along. We decided to make a weekly group scheduler, called Group Study Planner. It would allow users to make a study group. The app would calculate the best times for the group to meet based on each user’s schedule. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the design process, we had lots of ideas initially. It was hard to both learn the skills to build the app and also plan for future development. We met every week to discuss design and collaborate on the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app was built using Bootstrap MD and flexbox, and was hosted on Google’s hosting service Firebase. The web app featured a profile with contact information and a visual weekly schedule. Users could create a group, and invite fellow students. After creating a group, users could see the groups calculated availability, the group events, and the group members. Users could create events, with a weekly date, time, and location. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project allowed me to stretch my limits of web development, and allowed me to create the website you are viewing this on from scratch. It gave me a chance to dip my toes into web development while allowing me to work as a team.
