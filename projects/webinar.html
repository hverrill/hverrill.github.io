                    In this project, I worked together with a team of my fellow students to create a webinar about ethics and empathy in professional communication. Our goal was to research, collaborate, and professionally communicate our findings via a slide presentation and voiceover. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of our meetings were virtual. We kept track of meeting minutes and pooled our research. We used databases of academic papers provided by the school library to find research to formulate an opinion. Our webinar focused on how virtual meetings impact productivity, scientific research, privacy, telehealth, and how ethics and social standards change compared to in-person meetings.
                </p>

                    We had many design and logistical problems. One of our original team members didnâ€™t end up contributing, and we had to redistribute the workload. We had problems with making sure every team member was working with the same version of code.

                    Technically, the application uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the best route between airport locations. We used an XML document with a list of all major airports and their locations. The distance between each airport is calculated spherically, but the locations are displayed on a flat map. The application can calculate the total distance traveled and time traveled for any two locations.
